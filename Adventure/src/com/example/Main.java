/*
* Immutable classes
*   1. Don't provide "setter" methods â€” methods that modify fields or objects referred to by fields.
*   2. Make all fields final and private.
*   3. Don't allow subclasses to override methods. The simplest way to do this is to declare the class as final. A more
*      sophisticated approach is to make the constructor private and construct instances in factory methods.
*   4. If the instance fields include references to mutable objects, don't allow those objects to be changed:
*       Don't provide methods that modify the mutable objects.
*       Don't share references to the mutable objects. Never store references to external, mutable objects passed to
*       the constructor; if necessary, create copies, and store references to the copies. Similarly, create copies of
*       your internal mutable objects when necessary to avoid returning the originals in your methods.
